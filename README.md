# Prototype of Bukas

Upon the interview that we conducted with the owner of Sagum Farms, we learnt that one of the main struggles of the owner is not having
a system that can ease up her struggles in handling the financial, inventory and sales of the business as they base on manual 
computation and tracking of those. 

Do take note that our program wont be able to handle free hosting as we have sql triggers that requires paid hosting to work.
